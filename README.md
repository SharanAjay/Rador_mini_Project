## Rador_mini_Project
 Our college conducts a MICRO expo, where we ECE students all are supposed to do a mini project,so we made a simple mini project with rador and arduino.

# Radar-using-Arduino-UNO
Arduino Radar Project: A compact radar system built with Arduino Uno. Detect and display nearby objects using ultrasonic waves. Explore distance measurement and object detection in this DIY electronics project.
# Radar Project

This project implements a radar-like mechanism using Arduino Uno, a servo motor, an ultrasonic sensor, and Processing software. The system detects nearby objects using ultrasonic waves and displays them on a graphical interface.

## Installation

1. Connect the Arduino Uno to your computer.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch provided in the `arduino` directory to the Arduino Uno.
3. Install the Processing software on your computer.
4. Open the `processing` directory and run the `sketch_220408a.pde` sketch using Processing.
5. Ensure that the serial port in the Processing sketch matches the one used by Arduino.

## Usage

1. Launch the Processing sketch to display the radar interface.
2. The servo motor will start rotating, and the ultrasonic sensor will scan the surroundings.
3. Detected objects will be displayed on the radar screen as blips or dots.
4. The distance and angle of the detected objects will be shown alongside the blips.

## Components

- **Arduino Uno:** Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It is the main control unit of the radar system, responsible for reading data from the ultrasonic sensor, controlling the servo motor, and communicating with the Processing software.

- **Servo Motor:** The servo motor is used to rotate the ultrasonic sensor. By changing its position, the radar system can scan the surrounding area and detect objects from different angles.

- **Ultrasonic Sensor:** The ultrasonic sensor emits high-frequency sound waves and measures the time it takes for the waves to bounce back after hitting an object. By calculating the time difference, the distance of the object can be determined. The ultrasonic sensor plays a crucial role in detecting nearby objects in the radar system.

- **Processing Software:** Processing is an open-source software platform used for visual arts, creative coding, and data visualization. In this project, Processing is used to create the graphical interface that displays the radar-like mechanism. It receives data from the Arduino Uno about the detected objects and visualizes them on the screen.
